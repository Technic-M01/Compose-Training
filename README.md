# Compose Training
 
## Advanced States Project

This project was a travel app to demonstrate creating and using state holders with compose's APIs and how coroutines are implemented with compose.
One of the key features was using a custom 'Saver' object to store data and states that would survive recomposition and reconfiguration.
